# Correlation of Geological Features and Warming Rates
## By Jacklyn O'Brien & Nicholas Altland

This project was developed as a final project submission for the CS 3870: Data Science I class at the University of Vermont. We invtestigated the correlation between the geological features (land mass, elevation, coastline, etc.) and the increase in average temperature from 1960 to 2016 in 118 countries across the world. We sourced our data from across the web, collecting datasets from data websites and building our own from web scrapers. Using Python through Jupyter Notebook, we created a time series model to compare rates of warming over time, and found similarities between them using K-Means clustering.
